                        <p>OpenEvidence is designed

                            information to our health care professional users. We are committed to providing this
                            service<!-- --> <b>for free</b> and equally to all health care professionals, spanning the
                            entire spectrum from those at large, well-resourced institutions to those in small practices
                            across the country.<br /><br />To achieve this goal, we build and utilize state-of-the-art
                            technology to sift through tens of millions of potentially relevant documents and pieces of
                            information to find the most relevant and useful information for our users. To cover the
                            costs of this service, we show a limited number of controlled advertisements from closely
                            vetted advertisers.</p>
