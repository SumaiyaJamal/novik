                            using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and
                            capacity to agree to and abide by these Terms and that you are not prohibited from using the

                            you as a healthcare professional, they are in no way intended to serve as a diagnostic
                            service or platform, to provide certainty with respect to a diagnosis, to recommend a
                            particular product or therapy or to otherwise substitute for the clinical judgment of a
                            qualified healthcare professional. You agree that you will not use the Services with the
                            intention of creating any kind of physician/patient relationship, e.g., to diagnose or treat

                            qualified healthcare professional. For medical concerns, including decisions about
                            medications and other treatments, consumers should always consult their physician or, in
                            serious cases, seek immediate assistance from emergency medical personnel.</p>
