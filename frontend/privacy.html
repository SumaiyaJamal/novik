                            different privacy policy. In the event that we expand the OpenEvidence Platform through our
                            acquisition of another company and/or its properties, that company may operate under its own
                            privacy policy accessible via a link on its properties until we integrate its privacy
                            practices with ours, at which point a link to this Privacy Policy will be displayed on its

                            contain protected health information (PHI) or any information that violates the privacy of
                            any person. We provide the Services as a professional resource intended to support
                            healthcare professionals in their efforts to provide high quality medical care to patients.
                            You can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. If you do choose to use the

                                including by telephone. We will inform you in the research invitation if you will be

                                so that you can decide at that time if you wish to proceed with the opportunity. We do
                                not disclose your survey responses to the sponsor in a manner that identifies you.
